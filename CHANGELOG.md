# Carnalitas 1.3.5

Compatible with saved games from version 1.3 and up.

## New Features

### Lactation System

* Modders: added trait and character flag `carn_lactation_ignores_effective_age`. Useful for characters that aren't immortal but can lactate past menopause for whatever reason.

## Tweaks

* The "Make Love" notification will now appear if you do not have an eligible spouse or concubine but have an eligible lover.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed enslaving a ruler who is the primary attacker or defender in a war causing the game to bug out.
* Fixed fetish UI incorrectly showing the player's fetishes rather than the character's fetishes.
* Fixed body part traits appearing on the children of ruler designed characters when body part traits are turned off in game rules.
* Fixed children spawned by the "generate families" game rule inheriting misgendered body part traits.
* Added the character window bugfix from the CK3 1.2.2 hotfix update.
