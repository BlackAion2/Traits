# Carnalitas 1.5

NOT COMPATIBLE with earlier saved games.

## Body Parts Overhaul

In Carnalitas 1.5, each body part trait has been split into a positive and negative version. A new set of game rules allows you to choose whether each body part trait is considered a positive or negative congenital trait by the game.

New effects:
* `carn_flip_ruler_designed_dt_traits_to_game_rule_effect`
* `carn_add_inactive_dick_small_1_effect` (and so on for every body part trait)

New triggers:
* `carn_should_have_dick_trigger`
* `carn_should_have_tits_trigger`
* `carn_has_dick_small_1_trigger` (and so on for every body part trait)
* `carn_has_bad_dick_trigger`
* `carn_has_good_dick_trigger`
* `carn_has_bad_tits_trigger`
* `carn_has_good_tits_trigger`

## Tweaks

* Made birth control cost much less income and piety.
* Removed one of the two futa traits from the ruler designer. Choosing the futa trait in the ruler designer will now automatically give you the trait selected by the game rule on game start.
** Added `carn_flip_ruler_designed_futa_trait_to_game_rule_effect`

## Localization

* Updated Spanish localization.
