# Carnalitas 1.4.1

Compatible with saved games from Carnalitas version 1.4 and up.

## Removed Features

* Same-Sex Concubine interactions are no longer possible in CK3 1.3, as a result they have been temporarily removed from Carnalitas until Paradox lets us have fun again. :(

## Modding

* Changed `carn_can_become_same_sex_concubine_of_actor_trigger` to `carn_can_become_same_sex_concubine_of_character_trigger`.
* Added `carn_could_marry_same_sex_character_trigger`.
* Added `carn_can_be_offered_as_same_sex_concubine_to_character_trigger`.
* Added `carn_character_genders_can_produce_children_trigger`.

## Tweaks

* You now get stressed if you are Zealous and you enslave someone for whom enslavement is Shunned in your faith.
* You now get stressed if  you are Zealous and you moonlight as a prostitute when prostitution is Shunned in your faith.
* Now uses `seduction` event theme instead of `seduce_scheme` for consistency with internal Paradox event themes.
